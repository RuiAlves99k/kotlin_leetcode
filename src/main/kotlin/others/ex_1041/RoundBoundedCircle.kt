/**
 * On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north. Note that:
 *
 * The north direction is the positive direction of the y-axis.
 * The south direction is the negative direction of the y-axis.
 * The east direction is the positive direction of the x-axis.
 * The west direction is the negative direction of the x-axis.
 * The robot can receive one of three instructions:
 *
 * "G": go straight 1 unit.
 * "L": turn 90 degrees to the left (i.e., anti-clockwise direction).
 * "R": turn 90 degrees to the right (i.e., clockwise direction).
 * The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.
 *
 * Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: instructions = "GGLLGG"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
 * "G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
 * "G": move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.
 * "L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: West.
 * "L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: South.
 * "G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: South.
 * "G": move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: South.
 * Repeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 0).
 * Based on that, we return true.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: instructions = "GG"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
 * "G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
 * "G": move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.
 * Repeating the instructions, keeps advancing in the north direction and does not go into cycles.
 * Based on that, we return false.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: instructions = "GL"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
 * "G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
 * "L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 1). Direction: West.
 * "G": move one step. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: West.
 * "L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: South.
 * "G": move one step. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: South.
 * "L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: East.
 * "G": move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: East.
 * "L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 0). Direction: North.
 * Repeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (-1, 1) --> (-1, 0) --> (0, 0).
 * Based on that, we return true.
